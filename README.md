## Simple-Planetary-Physics
Simple Gravitational Physics Engine. 

# Current Features:
  Kinematic Objects which can move and interact with others, including other Kinematic Objects.
  Stationary Objects which cannot move but allow for the exertion of forces. Essentially just unmovable points of gravity. 
  Collision Detection and Deleting when Kinematic Objects enter the radius of stationary objects. 
  Visual representation with Matplotlib.

# Potential Features to be Added:
  Easy adding of objects to the system without needing to add objects by additional lines of code.
  Possible better visual implementation (more visually interesting, more accurate -> sizes of objects are proportional, etc).
